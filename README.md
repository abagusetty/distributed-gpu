<h1>Distributed GPU Backend for FFTX</h1>

This is the (planned) distributed GPU library backend for FFTX. This
library will support both multi-GPUs on a single node, and multi-GPUs
across different nodes in a distributed system.

<a href="http://spiral.net/doc/fftx/introduction.html">FFTX</a>
is the exascale follow-on to the FFTW open source discrete FFT
package for executing the Fast Fourier Transform as well as
higher-level operations composed of linear operations combined with
DFT transforms. Though backwards compatible with FFTW, this is an
entirely new work developed as a cooperative effort between Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory, Carnegie Mellon University, and
SpiralGen, Inc.
